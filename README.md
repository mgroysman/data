 
# Proposal

Through this project, we seek to understand the relationship between internet access and inequality on a global scale. We will use data from the United Nations to compare selected socio-economic indexes to international communication measurements.

We have outlined our questions, data sources, and folder structure below for those interested in replicating our work. 

## Questions

> Has the internet become more centralized since 2000? That is to say: "Has number of internet providers kept pace with the number of users?"

Null: The relative number of internet access providers has not changed since 2000.

Alternate: The relative number of internet access providers has changed since 2000.

> Does this change in provider/user density indicate a change in the larger economics of technology.

Null: There are no signs that this density change has transformed the economics of tech. 

Alternate: There are signs that this density change has transformed the economics of tech.  

## Motivation

We are interested in this problem as data scientists because our field is a mixed bag. On one hand, big data can be used to influence elections, spread hateful propaganda, and be used to track every purchase and decision we make. These political consequences are well known. However, the Internet has a history of

### Data Exploration

### Data Preparation

## Tests
+ Chi-Square
+ R^2 
+ Correlation
+(depends on data from worldbank)

## Further Modelling

+ What we propose to offer. I suggest a website and data analysis application. The 608 'Dash' stuff, essentially.

## Further Collection

+ Automate data collection
+ create database
+ store data

## Filesystem
+ old/: old paper
