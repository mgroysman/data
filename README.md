 
# Proposal

Through this project, we seek to understand the relationship between internet access and inequality on a global scale. We will use data from the United Nations to compare selected socio-economic indexes to international communication measurements.

We have outlined our questions, data sources, and folder structure below for those interested in replicating our work. 

## Questions

> What economic indicators are most strongly correlated with internet access rates? Can we build a model that accurately predicts said rates?

> Does this model change when our internet access parameter changes?
  

## Motivation

We are interested in this problem as data scientists because our field is a mixed bag. On one hand, big data can be used to influence elections, spread hateful propaganda, and be used to track every purchase and decision we make. These political consequences are well known. However, the Internet has a history of advancing economies. We'd like to investigate the relationship between technology and the economy and see if we can build models resilient to the particle type of device.
